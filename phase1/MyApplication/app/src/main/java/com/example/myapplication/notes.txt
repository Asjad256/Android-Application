so for the user class it currently has 3 variables one is the score which i think whack a mole updates,
type racer can as well one is streaks you can literally change that to whatever you want for typeracer, just
make sure you're changing the getter and setters as well, so i added a user in every single activity
in our program so think of it like the user info is literally being passed around from screen to screen all
the way to the end, with info being updated by each game, all your game needs to do is update the statistic
by calling user.set whatever variable and also use the user.get method accordingly if you need to, you can
look at the checkexit method in mazeview to see how i updated the num games played. You will have to call
UserManager.update_statistics(getApplicationContext(), user.getscore or whatever, user.get second statistic, user.get third statistic);
you gotta pass in the context dont forget lol. e.g if you're game only updates one statistic you still need to pass all
three in the function even ifthe other two are the same this function will store the updated
statistics now here's the main part this function should only be called in 3 cases to save
processing time not whenever you update the statistic

A. When the user dies in you're game only then save the statistics in the file
B. When the user has succesfully finished you're game
C. in methods like onPause and onDestroy when the user decides to leave the game

the reason why im saying in these 3 cases is cause whenever the update statistics is called it essentially
loops over the entire statistics file and changes the statistics of that user and stores everything in a string
and then overwrites the file. I gotta do this cause well in java simply replacing the line won't change the file
it didn't work and i double checked from multiple resources online so yeah. If you want add a 4th statistic for
the user lemme know ill have to make some minor adjustments in 3 functions in the usermanager class and it should be
all good.
