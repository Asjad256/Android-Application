# Android-Application
This is an Android app consiting of a login system and 3 games i.e (whack a mole, Type Racer and Maze).
The Phase 2 folder in the repository corresponds to the latest version of the application.
Demo video showing the parts of the application I made: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NbWsipmQIMqNMF-4DvFfd26eu0uGoGXG/view?usp=sharing
I made the login system and was responsible for creating the user class and keeping track of user information and game statitistics, and making the scoreboard which compares the statistics of the user logged in with other user accounts on the phone, and the creation of the maze game.
